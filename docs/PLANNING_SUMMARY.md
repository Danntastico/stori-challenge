## 🏗️ Final Architecture

```
Tech Stack (MVP):

Frontend:
├── React 18 + Vite
├── TailwindCSS (styling)
├── Recharts (visualization)
└── Axios (HTTP client)

Backend:
├── Go 1.22+
├── chi router (1 dependency!)
├── Standard library
└── Embedded JSON data

AI:
└── OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo

Deployment:
├── Frontend: S3 + CloudFront
├── Backend: EC2 (t3.micro)
└── Local: Docker Compose
```

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Repository pattern (enables future DB swap)
- Service layer (business logic separation)
- Clean architecture (clear boundaries)
- Mobile-first responsive design

---

## ✅ Strategic Decisions

### What We're Building (MVP)
- ✅ Read-only data visualization
- ✅ Embedded JSON data source
- ✅ Server-side aggregation
- ✅ OpenAI-powered advice
- ✅ Mobile-responsive UI
- ✅ Docker Compose setup
- ✅ AWS deployment

### What We're Documenting (Future)
- 📝 Database migration path (PostgreSQL)
- 📝 CRUD operations
- 📝 Multi-account support
- 📝 Budget tracking
- 📝 Advanced filtering
- 📝 Authentication (Cognito)

**Rationale:** Challenge is a **scoping test**. Building features they didn't ask for could backfire. Instead, we demonstrate product thinking through well-articulated future vision.

---

## 📊 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AWS deployment fails | Docker Compose as backup demo |
| OpenAI API issues | Mock fallback response |
| Time runs short | MVP (Days 1-2) is complete submission |
| Go learning curve | Simple handlers, clear structure |
| Chart rendering issues | Recharts → Chart.js fallback |

---

## 🚀 What Makes This Solution Great

### Shows Restraint
- Go with 1 dependency (chi)
- JSON instead of over-engineered database
- Simple EC2 vs complex serverless (for reliability)

### Shows Breadth  
- Frontend: React + modern tooling
- Backend: Go + REST APIs
- DevOps: Docker + AWS deployment
- AI: OpenAI integration

### Shows Product Sense
- User stories aligned with requirements
- Mobile-first design
- Future roadmap demonstrates vision

### Shows Architecture
- Repository pattern (extensibility)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Well-documented tradeoffs

### Shows Delivery
- MVP-first approach
- Clear 4-day timeline
- Low-risk implementation plan

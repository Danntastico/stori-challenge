# Stori’s Full Stack Challenge
## Welcome to the Challenge!

Hey there! We're thrilled you're interested in joining Stori as a Full Stack Engineer. We’ve put together a real-world challenge to get a glimpse of how you solve problems, make decisions, and build scalable systems in a financial services startup.

### Challenge Overview
Your goal is to design and build a mobile-friendly web application that helps users track their expenses and get AI-powered financial advice. The application should have a frontend interface, a backend with REST APIs and it should be hosted in AWS cloud.

### The Scenario
You are part of a team tasked with building a tool to help customers understand their spending habits and give them some advice. The UI should enable users to:
1. See a summary of spending by expense category
2. See a timeline of income and expenses
3. Get advice about how to manage spending to save more money

### What You'll Build
Build a working prototype of your system that:
- For the above bullet points 1 and 2, create the endpoint(s) needed to render the web application and load the attached sample data so the user can see the graphs/dashboard that visualize the data in a useful way. (Extra points if the endpoints are built with Go).
- The UI design can be simple. We are not testing your product designer skills. Some ideas are included at the end of this file. Extra points if you use AI tools to create the design.
- For bullet point 3, create a personal AI-assisted agent to give financial advice (such as about spending and saving money). Hint: have no fear! No complex AI agents needed. You can use the SDK of your favorite LLM provider (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and just pass in an input prompt (with data) to get an output answer, which can be displayed as text in the UI.

### What to Submit
Please submit the following:
1. Working Code
   1. Source code in a public git repository.
   2. README.md file that provides high level documentation of what your app does or any other information you feel is useful
2. Evaluation
   1. How did you test your system? Either write code to test your app OR write a paragraph to explain what code you would write to test your app.
3. System Design Overview: In 1–2 paragraphs:
   1. Briefly describe your system architecture. Please include an architectural diagram to help illustrate how the main components interact.
   2. What design tradeoffs or assumptions did you make? What are strengths and weaknesses of your architecture?
   3. What additional features would you think users would like to have? What would you improve iF given more time?

### What We’re Looking For
We’re less interested in perfect performance and more interested in:
- Your reasoning and autonomy.
- Your ability to scope and solve real-world problems.
- Your sense of product thinking and system design.

We hope you enjoy the challenge—and we’re excited to see how you think, build, and solve.
Good luck!
